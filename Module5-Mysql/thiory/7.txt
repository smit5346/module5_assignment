question 7 :What is DML Compiler in SQL?

-->A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert), 
delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database. A DML is typically a sublanguage of a larger database language
 like SQL, with the DML containing some of the language's operators.

-->A DML compiler in SQL converts Data Manipulation Language (DML) instructions into machine language 
(a low-level language). DML is a set of SQL commands that are used to manipulate data in database tables or query views. DML commands include: 
--INSERT: Adds new or updated values to the database 
--UPDATE: Changes or updates existing data to a more recent value within the database 
--DELETE: Deletes values or data information from the current table in the database

-->DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the 
operators in the language. Data analysts, scientists, engineers, and anyone using SQL rely on DML in order to access, 
transform, and analyze data.
