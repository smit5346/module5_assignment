Question 1 : What do you understand By Database?

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. In the context of SQL (Structured Query Language), a database is a system that stores and manages data in a structured format, typically using tables. SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.

Key Concepts in SQL Databases:
Tables: The fundamental building blocks of a relational database. A table consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.

Schema: Defines the structure of the database, including the tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that each entry is distinct.

Foreign Key: A field in one table that links to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

Queries: SQL commands used to retrieve data from the database. The SELECT statement is the most commonly used SQL query.

Transactions: A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, ensuring data integrity. Transactions typically follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Indexes: Structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table, at the cost of additional storage space.

Normalization: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Views: Virtual tables created by a query. Views do not store data themselves but display data from one or more tables based on a query.

Stored Procedures: Precompiled collections of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit.
