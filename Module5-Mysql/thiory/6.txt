question 6 :What is DDL Interpreter?

-->DDL Interpreter: It interprets the DDL (Data Definition Language) Instructions and stores the record 
in a data dictionary (in a table containing meta-data) Query Optimizer: It executes the DML Instructions 
and picks the lowest cost evaluation plan out of all the alternatives present.
-->A Data Definition Language (DDL) interpreter changes DDL statements into a format that the storage manager
 can understand. It also stores the record in a data dictionary, which is a table that contains meta-data. 
-->DDL is a computer language that's used to build and change the structure of database objects, 
such as tables, views, indexes, and schemas. DDL statements can create, modify, and remove these objects,
 and can also impose or drop constraints on tables. Some common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and RENAME
